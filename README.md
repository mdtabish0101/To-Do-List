# React To-Do List

A simple and elegant to-do list application built with React. This app allows users to add, update, delete, and track their tasks efficiently. The app uses arrays and lists to store tasks locally within the app's stateâ€”no backend or external storage involved.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the to-do list
- delete tasks
- Tasks stored in app state (React hooks)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic for managing tasks (add, delete, mark complete).
- **React Hooks (useState)**: Manage the app's state, including task storage.

## Problems

- Since it is a List app one potential down is that we are not using local storage yet which means that once the user refresh the page all the todos will disappear
